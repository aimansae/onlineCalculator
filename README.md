# Simple Calculator with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) - [React](https://react.dev/)


## This is modern and responsive calculator built using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. 

This project is not just a tool for simple arithmetic‚Äîit's a reflection of my learning journey, where I explored concepts like state management, conditional rendering, styling logic, and edge case handling.

## Introduction
This project started as a way to solidify my understanding of:

- React state management
- Dynamic UI rendering
- Button highlighting and logic validation
- User input handling and evaluation

It mimics a real calculator, allowing users to:

- Perform calculations
- View previous results
- Use percentage, delete, and reset options

## What I Learned
- Building clean and reusable components (`Button`)
- Handling edge cases (like multiple operators)
- Highlighting active buttons with conditional styling
- Storing and retrieving last calculation using `localStorage`
- Managing component logic flow (e.g. after pressing `=`, start new input)

## Challenges
- Ensuring operators don‚Äôt stack (e.g., preventing `6++6`)
- Highlighting numeric and operator buttons correctly
- Resetting UI after result view (`=`, `Last` click)
- Keeping input and result display logic clean and intuitive

These helped me better understand how to write readable logic and separate UI behavior.

## Technologies Used
- [React](https://react.dev/) / [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
- [TypeScrip](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/config/typescript)
- [Tailwind CSS for NextJS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/framework-guides/nextjs)
- LocalStorage (for "Last" feature)
